### Sargam-spec

This is a Clojure specification to document Hindustani classical compositions in Bhatkhande notation format. It will also support serialization to (and from) JSON.

Compositions can have parts (e.g Sthyai, Antara and multiple Taans) as well as the Taal the composition is set in, or it can be saved with a single part.
